## SYSDEV - Fullstack Assesment Frontend

This a submission for a fullstack role in Sysdev samahan, I have created a basic fullstack that requests 3 types of data from external, constant and backend data. 

This application needs the backend to work in some pages so get the backend running
- [Backend](https://github.com/khesir/SYSDEV-Fullstack-assessment-submission-backend)

### Stages
I just finished the whole project that satisfies all stages, but after submission I was informed to I need to separate each stages so I just make a notes here.

1. Stage 1 : Simple card, check the directory `/src/components/card.tsx` for the card code.

2. Stage 2 : User Card List, I have created 3 pages to list all data in different ways visit this pages `/constant` `/external` `/backend`. To see the code for all pages view the directory `/src/pages`

3. Stage 3 : Load more button is already implemented to `/constant` and `/backend` see the code in the `src/pages`
